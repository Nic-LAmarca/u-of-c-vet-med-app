1. Run the sql file "ENSF607PROJECT" in mySQL to build the database and populate all tables.
2. Run the java file "Api607Application".
3. Enter the command "nodemon server.js" in the "server folder from the terminal".
4. Enter the command "npm start" in the "ui" folder from the terminal.
5. Use the web-application in the desired browser.

## Endpoints
These are the stages that were followed in order to build and test each of the endpoints.

### 1. Database
To complete the endpoint examples for this portion of the project, we decided it would be easiest to quickly create a sample database that would be similar to what will actually be used as an end result. We did so in MySQL by creating a new database with a simple SQL command and then used Table Data Import Wizard to populate the database with the data provided by Majid in an excel spreadsheet.

### 2. Project Application
After the database was created, we then wrote the necessary classes and interfaces to execute some GET and PUT requests from the database that may be seen in the final project result.

### 3. Quality Assurance
To ensure that these requests worked, we used Postman and created a workspace for our team to test the results.

### 4. Requests
Below, we show each of the endpoints that have been created and tested. In order to test these results, a new user would need to first create a database and then pull our program from our GitHub repository before testing the results on Postman.
